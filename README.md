# RustDagcuter
Dagcuter is a Rust library for executing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks. It manages task dependencies, detects circular dependencies, and supports customizable task lifecycles (PreExecution, Execute, and PostExecution). It also enables concurrent execution of independent tasks for improved performance.
